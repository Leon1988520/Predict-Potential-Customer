# Predict-Potential-Customer
Here we will be using Bank Marketing campaign dataset to train a Machine Learning Model for predicting if user will buy a bank Term Deposit or not.

Our Prediciton can help Marketing team to get Better overview of Future customers to Focus on or Policy to follow that will lead to higher  chance of customer buying Term Deposit.

I will be breaking the entire working into following stages:

1] Feature Engineering or Undestanding the feature Set

2] Repair my dataset for any breakdowns or missing values in dataset

3] Decide on important features to be used for processing (tunning required/ high end could be either using PCA/SVD for top features selection before Hyperparameter Selection)

4] Decide on an ML algo for training our Model

5] Testing the model

6] Parameter tuning for more accurate results.


The dataset used for my experiment is available here and has following features:-
"age";"job";"marital";"education";"default";"housing";"loan";"contact";"month";"day_of_week";"duration";"campaign";"pdays";"previous";"poutcome";"emp.var.rate";"cons.price.idx";"cons.conf.idx";"euribor3m";"nr.employed"
